                            As a highly motivated and dedicated student with strong interpersonal and communication skills, I would like to
                            apply for internships.
                            As a student I have been extensively involved in my school projects, which has allowed me to develop strong
                            technucal skills. My involvement in various events, including church drama and sports carnivals, has allowed me
                            to work closely with my peers while supporting the church as a whole.
                            These experiences have allowed me to develop strong time management and organisational skills, which I see as
                            being very important when seeking internship .
                            Personal attributes that I believe make me task oriented :
                            <br><br>
                            Motivation: Volunteer participation.
                            <br><br>
                            Communication: Acting in drama performances has allowed the development of communication skills.
                            <br><br>
                            I enjoy working with others and believe that my strong communication skills will ensure that I can meet the
                            expectations.
                            I believe that I have a lot to offer. I am keen to develop my technical skills.
